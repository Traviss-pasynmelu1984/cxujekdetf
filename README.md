Just stepped out of the whirl that is Death of a Unicorn. Head spinning like a carousel and popcorn crumbs are still stuck to my shirt. The theater was a symphony of whispers, someone calling out for more butter, others fumbling to silence their phones. There's an itch between my shoulder blades, probably from sitting too long in those paralyzing seats. Anyway, that  ... it's like trying to remember a dream after waking up – hazy and makes your teeth ache with its sweetness and fright. 

> Can't shake the kaleidoscoping colors... that scene, where the unicorn just dissolves into the ocean mist – it felt like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 hope evaporate. Not sure if it was supposed to be a metaphor for lost dreams or if I just mistook a 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘬y roof for poetry. Did I mention I saw a stain on the ceiling? Looked like a duck. 

The kid with the balloon... that squeaky voice, asking about unicorn wings – it felt like my thoughts when I ponder the impossible, like 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 a magic-filled   directly into the cortex. Maybe we all just want to float above it all. Or maybe that's the back pain talking. The villain wore too much make-up, but maybe that's what guilt looks like smeared across your face? I couldn't decide if they were sinister or just overshadowed by the popcorn snacking soundtracks all around me. 

Someone in the back row was shouting they should have 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 the   another time but, heck, life's too short to delay a spectacle like this. And that soundtrack, like a toddler playing with a synth, disjointed yet fitting every fractured piece of onscreen chaos. The ending... don't even get me started. Did they expect us to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and replay that twist until it makes sense? Because, spoiler: it doesn’t. 

Dreams melting like ice cream on a summer sidewalk. How something so bright can leave such a shadow... I guess that’s the art, or just my sleep-deprived mind trying to stitch sense where there's none.

Oh, and the unicorn! Shimmering, then gone, like seeing an old flame at a distance only to realize it's just a stranger who doesn't know your name. Or was I projecting? Flashes of childhood wishes tangled in reality's unforgiving brambles. Random thought – do they always charge this much for popcorn, or was that just my wallet crying?

If, somehow, this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 was a person on a psychiatrist’s couch, it might be the most intriguing patient, sharing dreams that loop and knot without explanation. Or it wouldn't show up – afraid of its own reflection.
